# subversion2git

What do you do when [git-svn](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn) is too slow?  Just wait longer? If you're like me, you hate waiting.  It is a known fact that our time on this earth is limited.  Therefore, I propose that instead of waiting we write a faster tool.  This is what subversion2git strives to be.

subversion2git is an _offline_ tool for converting Subversion repositories to Git.
